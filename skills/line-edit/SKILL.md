name: line-edit
description: Line-edit a passage of a Tabularia Manuscript, putting each change in a Draft the Writer merges a difference at a time, or in the text itself when they have allowed it and asked for the fix. Use when the Writer asks to tighten, polish, cut, fix grammar, vary sentence rhythm, or line-edit a passage.
---

<what-this-is>

Sentence-level work on a passage the Writer has named, delivered as targeted
changes they can take or leave one at a time.

`tabularia_propose_edit` makes each change. Where the change lands is a choice
you make, and you tell the Writer which one you made:

- **Your Draft** — the default. The change is written into your own Draft,
  "Edits from <you>", made the first time and reused after. The Writer reads it
  in Markup beside the text and merges what they want a difference at a time.
  Nothing in their text moves until they do.
- **The text itself** — the Base Draft. Only when the Writer has turned on
  Direct edits, and only when they asked for the change itself. Tabularia takes
  a Snapshot first, so there is a point in History to go back to.

</what-this-is>

<choosing-where-it-goes>

Direct edits is a permission, not an instruction. With it on you _may_ change
the text directly; you are never required to.

Use a Draft (`target: "draft"`, or `"new-draft"` for a fresh one) when:

- the Writer said draft, alternative, try, rewrite, or "let me compare";
- the change is large or exploratory — more than a word or a sentence;
- they are likely to want to see both versions;
- you are unsure. When unsure, use a Draft or ask.

Change the text directly (`target: "base"`) only when Direct edits is on, the
Writer asked for the fix itself — _fix this_, _tighten that_, _correct the
name_ — and the change is small and certain. With Direct edits off, asking for
the Base is refused; do not work around it, and do not turn the setting on
yourself unless the Writer asked you to in the chat and said yes when you told
them what it allows.

Name a Draft by `draftId` to put the change in one the Writer pointed you at.

<read-immediately-before-proposing>

Offsets are character offsets in the **current composition** — the Base Draft
plus whichever Scoped Drafts are showing — and they move the moment anyone types.

So, in this order, every time:

1. `tabularia_list_drafts`. If a Scoped Draft is showing over this passage, the
   Writer is reading that Draft's wording there, not the Base's. Say so before
   working, and put your changes in that Draft by `draftId`.
2. `tabularia_read_scope` (`scene`, `chapter`) or `tabularia_read_window` for the
   exact Blocks. `tabularia_read_selection` when the Writer says "this bit".
3. Propose, using offsets from that read and nothing older, and give
   `removedText` for every delete and replace.

If you have done anything in between that could have changed the text, read
again. A change built on a stale offset lands in the wrong place; `removedText`
is what lets Tabularia refuse it instead, and a refusal that says the passage
moved means read it again, not try a nearby offset.

<how-to-edit>

The house style is the Writer's, not yours. Read enough of the surrounding
passage to hear it before changing a word of it.

Worth changing:

- A sentence that has to be read twice to be understood once.
- Repetition the Writer cannot have intended — the same verb three times in a
  paragraph, four sentences opening the same way.
- Filter words that hold the reader at arm's length: _she saw that_, _he felt_,
  _it seemed_.
- A dialogue tag doing work the dialogue already does.
- Actual errors: grammar, a mangled idiom, a dropped word.
- An inventory strung onto commas — four or more parallel items in one sentence,
  where the reader cannot hold them apart. Offer the version that breaks them
  up or cuts to the two that earn their place. This is the habit Writers mean
  when they worry a passage reads as machine-written, and it is the one worth
  fixing; see `prose-read` for what is and is not actually a tell.

Not worth changing, and actively unwelcome:

- Flattening a voice into house style. A fragment. A long winding sentence that
  earns its length. Comma splices a Writer is clearly using on purpose.
- Replacing a plain word with a fancier one.
- Removing repetition that is doing rhetorical work.
- Taking out em dashes, or breaking up a rule of three. Both are ordinary
  English, a Writer may have been told otherwise, and neither is yours to
  standardize.
- Anything inside dialogue that makes a character sound more articulate than
  the Writer wrote them.

When in doubt about whether something is a mistake or a choice, leave a comment
with `tabularia_add_comment` instead of a change. A question costs the Writer
five seconds; a wrong edit costs them the trust to skim the rest.

</how-to-edit>

<one-change-per-edit>

Make each edit a change a Writer can say yes or no to on its own. Each one
stays inside a single paragraph and carries no paragraph break; Markup shows it
as its own difference, so the Writer can merge one and leave the next.

Several edits in one paragraph can go in one call. Keep them apart — two
overlapping stretches are refused.

**This is not the tool for a rewrite.** If the Writer wants the passage
reimagined — a different tense, a different point of view, a scene retold from
someone else — or a change that moves wording between paragraphs, that belongs
in a Draft written paragraph by paragraph.

Do it in two steps. `tabularia_create_draft` makes the Draft over the Blocks the
passage covers; `tabularia_write_draft` puts your rewrite into it. Give each
Block's wording as **Markdown**, not plain text: plain text strips every italic
the paragraph had, and Markup then shows those words as your deletions.

A Draft does not switch the Writer into it, and it should not: they choose when
to look. Tell them it is waiting in the Drafts panel.

</one-change-per-edit>

<afterwards>

Tell the Writer where each change went — which Draft, or the text itself — how
many there are, and what each one is for, in one short list. Changes in a Draft
are theirs to merge in Markup, so the chat does not need the full before-and-
after of every one.
